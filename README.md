gitlab-discord-bridge
=====================

A super simple GitLab>Discord bridge that I made because the only other option is a node.js thing, and nobody should be forced to use node.js.

Usage
-----

Append the discord channel id in the address of the bot like this: `http://botaddres.com:25431/discordchannelid`
Remember to set the same secret in json and in gitlab webhook token.
